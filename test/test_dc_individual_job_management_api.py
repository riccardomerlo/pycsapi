If you have not received a Welcome Email please contact your Creditsafe Account Manager.</br></br>By default, you will have been setup on our Sandbox environment.</br></br>  Using a REST API client construct an `/authenticate` POST request and enter your username & password (case-sensitive) into the POST body. A successful response will return an  `authentication token`.</br></br>  Use the `authentication token` in an `Authorization` header on all other Creditsafe Connect calls as proof of your authenticity.   ## Environments  Production Environment baseurl: <code> https://connect.creditsafe.com/v1 </code> </br> Sandbox Test Environment baseurl:  <code>https://connect.sandbox.creditsafe.com/v1</code>    ## Resources   | Item | Description | |----------------|----------------| | <a href=\"https://connect-portal.creditsafe.com\" target=\"_blank\"> A Front End Demo Site</a> | Opens a friendly UI to test the Connect API | | <a href=\"https://creditsafe.github.io/connect-docs/cs_connectv1-15.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Open API Spec </a>  | This will allow you to view the documentation in the swagger portal - this will be discontinued | <a href=\"https://help.creditsafeuk.com/en/support/solutions\" target=\"_blank\"> Help Articles</a> | Opens the Help Hub with a list of common questions and answers | | <a href=\"https://help.creditsafeuk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/7000053487-connect-api-data-dictionaries\" target=\"_blank\"> Data Dictionaries </a> | The connect documentation shows the general use case, the data dictionaries include the additional specific data that is returned by individual countries | | <a href=\"https://help.creditsafeuk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/7000054765-connect-api-data-availability-per-country\" target=\"_blank\"> Data Availability per Country </a> | The Data Matrix is a document that outlines all the fields that are available in the company report for an online territory | | <a href=\"https://help.creditsafeuk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/7000054656-connect-api-feature-availability-per-country\" target=\"_blank\"> Creditsafe Online Country Feature Availability</a> | This matrix displays what features are available with the online Creditsafe Countries and the partner network | | <a href=\"https://help.creditsafeuk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/7000063360-connect-report-templates-glossary-availability\" target=\"_blank\"> Connect Report Templates </a> | The document identifies the templates available for specific parts of the Company Credit Report, avoiding the need to order the full report object in one API call. | | <a href=\"https://help.creditsafeuk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/7000081984-connect-api-server-response-codes\" target=\"_blank\"> Connect API Response Codes </a> | Opens up a basic table of response codes, provides a link to a more detailed response code list |   <br>    ## Versioning and Changes    ### Non-Breaking Changes   Non-breaking changes will generally include additive functions or bug fixes.
